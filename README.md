# Analyzing tweets with python
In this project we are experimenting with the Twitter API. Our main objective is to provide a model capable of recognizing trends in young people, this will help us create events related to these trends so that more people are interested.

# Requirements
- Python 3.0+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- pandas
- tweepy
- nltk

# Notes
The file `Learning Twitter API` contains all the experiments I was doing when Learning this technology, in the last section of this notebook is the important thing, I obtain the first 100 tweets from the first 100 followers of any account, I chose a pana [Rodolfo Ferro](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro) for this experiment. 

After this, I preprocessed every obtained tweet so we can apply NLP and know what is that tweet about C:. This preprocess thingy is in the file `Preprocessing.ipynb`.

# Work in Progress
- Make a better looking README.
- Apply the model to classify the tweets.
- Scaling.
